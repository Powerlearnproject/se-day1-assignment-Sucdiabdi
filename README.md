Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Refers to appliying software methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality sotware.
 Software engineering plays an important role in the technology field  where it enables creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solutions that meet user needs.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages -eg C . Establishment of software engineering as displine and Rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a conceptual model which includes policies and 
procedures for developing or altering systems throughout their life cycles.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall - Sequential approach with distinct phases eg . requirement ,design ,implementation.
Agile - alterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - writes codes and implements software
Quality asuarance engineer - ensures software quality by testing the software
Project manager - oversees planning ,execution of a software.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) -  Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
version control systems - oftware tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight deadlines
technical debt
changing requirements
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software.
Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Integration Testing -  Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering refers to crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
prompt engineering helps in avoiding vague answers by giving clear and concise questions
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what is AI ?
explain artificial intelligence and all it entails .
